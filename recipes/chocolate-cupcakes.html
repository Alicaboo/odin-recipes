         <h3>Rich, fluffy chocolate cupcakes made with cocoa powder and topped with a smooth, decadent chocolate frosting. They’re easy to make, deeply chocolatey, and perfect for birthdays, cravings, or dramatic late-night baking decisions.</h3>
         <p>These chocolate cupcakes start with a soft, moist batter made from cocoa powder, sugar, and a touch of milk to keep things tender. The cupcakes bake into light but chocolate-forward little sponges, with a fine crumb that holds up beautifully under frosting.</p>
         <p>The chocolate frosting is creamy, silky, and unapologetically indulgent. Made with butter, powdered sugar, and melted chocolate or cocoa, it spreads or pipes easily and sets just enough to feel luxurious without being stiff. Together, cupcake and frosting strike a balance between comforting and indulgent, like a hug that also contains chocolate.</p>
